                <p class="info">With the companies use of White space we are able to see the difference between each section.  Also it draws the eye to the Logo which is a stark contrast to white background causing it to stick out.</p>

                <p class="info">I have worked for Leslie's many times in the past and their website has come a long way in that time.  I am glad to see that in the mobile view it gives a greater look to the site.  With the use of Visual Hierarchy our eyes are drawn to the Request Service button.  No it's no the biggest thing on the page but amongst the blues and darker colors that Red is what pops out to me.  This is a great thing in that Leslie's number one goal is providing top notch customer service.</p>

                <img class="web-example" src="images/apple.png" alt="Apple home page">
                <p class="info">Apple has always lead the market in providing the simplest to use device so why would that not translate to their website.  We can see just a few option to pick from on this homepage.  We have the learn more about the device, buy or we can go to our cart.  This is an execellent use of Hick's Law keeping it simple as to not overwhelm the customer experience they are trying to achieve.</p>
