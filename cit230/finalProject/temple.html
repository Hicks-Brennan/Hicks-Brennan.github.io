                                <p>The Mesa Arizona Temple was the first temple built in Arizona.

                                        The Mesa Arizona Temple was the first temple to present the endowment in a language other than English. (The first non-English session was presented in Spanish in 1945.)
                                        
                                        The Mesa Arizona Temple was the first temple to reopen to the public for an open house prior to a rededication.
                                        
                                        The Mesa Arizona Temple was originally named the Arizona Temple.</p>

                                <p>The St. George Utah Temple is the longest operating temple of the Church and was the first built in Utah.

                                        The St. George Utah Temple was originally named the St. George Temple.
                                        
                                        The St. George Utah Temple is the first temple where endowments for the dead were performed.
                                        
                                        The St. George Utah Temple is the only temple completed during Brigham Young's 30-year tenure as president of the Church. He purchased a winter home in the city and visited the temple site as often as possible during its construction. He gave frequent direction and stayed informed of the progress by telegram or letter when staying in Salt Lake City.</p>

                                <p>The Newport Beach Planning Commission gave its approval for the Newport Beach California Temple on October 3, 2002, despite protests from the numerous residents in attendance. The Church worked closely with residents in a spirit of compromise, making changes in response to their concerns that included turning off flood lighting by 11:00 p.m., changing the color of the building from off-white to an earth-tone shade of seashell, and reducing the height of the spire from 124 feet to 100 feet.

                                        On November 12, 2002, the Newport Beach City Council gave final approval for the temple upon agreement by the Church to make a second reduction in the height of the steeple from 100 feet to 90 feet. The 10-foot concession gained yards in public relations, as staunch opponents embraced the compromise, saying they were ready to move forward as a community.
                                        
                                        Ground was broken for the temple on Friday, August 15, 2003, in the presence of area authorities, local Church leaders, civic leaders, temple architects, and media representatives. Elder Duane B. Gerrard, first counselor in the North America West Area presidency, presided and dedicated the temple site.
                                        
                                        On January 13, 2005, a statue of the angel Moroni crowned the temple. During placement, a remarkable solar halo was visible, which surrounded the sun. Once Moroni was in place, the phenomenon dissipated.</p>

                                <p>The Manhattan New York Temple was the second multipurpose temple of the Church, following the Hong Kong China Temple (1996).

                                        The Manhattan New York Temple was the second temple built in the state of New York, following the Palmyra New York Temple (2000).
                                        
                                        The Manhattan New York Temple was the third temple built from an existing building, following the Vernal Utah Temple (1997) and the Copenhagen Denmark Temple (2004). The temple is virtually a building within a building, which is completely soundproofed from the hustle and bustle of the City. The original building was a multi-purpose stake center built in 1976.
                                        
                                        The cornerstone of the Manhattan New York Temple is located within the multi-purpose building but on an exterior wall of the temple.</p>
